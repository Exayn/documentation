# Why Exayn ?

Operating in the cryptocurrency market necessitates dealing with multiple exchanges, each with its own set of APIs. These APIs differ in **structure**, **conventions**, and **complexity**, making it a daunting task to integrate and maintain them in your application.

**Exayn** addresses this challenge by providing a universal interface to interact with multiple cryptocurrency exchanges. Here's why Exayn should be your go-to solution:

1. **Simplified Integration**: With Exayn, you only need to understand and integrate with one API - ours. This significantly reduces the learning curve and integration time.

2. **Enhanced Productivity**: By reducing the complexity of dealing with multiple APIs, developers can focus more on their core functionalities, enhancing productivity.

3. **Reduced Maintenance**: Each exchange API evolves independently, which might require continuous updates on your side. Exayn takes care of these updates, ensuring your application remains functional with minimal maintenance.

4. **Unified Data Representation**: Exayn provides a consistent data structure across different exchanges, making it easier to handle and interpret the data.
