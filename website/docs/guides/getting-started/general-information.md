# General Information

This page contains come information that you need to be aware of.

## IP Limits

For Cloud service, there is IP limits by API key. Here the detail :

| Type        | Limit | Interval |
| ----------- | ----- | -------- |
| Market data | 200   | 10s      |
| Withdraw    | 10    | 10s      |
| Orders      | 100   | 10s      |

Those limits are subject to change. We are making tests to find the best limits we can handle.
